# @nw55/common - js/ts library

This library is still very much a work-in-progress.

Until this library reaches the first stable version 1.0, there may be frequent breaking changes.
With version 0.2 the package was split into mulitple smaller packages.

Pull requests are welcome for bug fixes but not currently for new features.

Documentation and more tests will be added at a later time.
